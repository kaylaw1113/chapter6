This repository contains the code from the chapter 6 example of Ionic in Action. The example is a weather app that displays current details for any number of locations.

Here are the primary things we do in this chapter.

* Setup and use a side menu for primary navigation
* Use popups to confirm choices and alert the user about details
* Create a settings view to manage the app preferences
* Create custom scrolling experience with 'pages'
* Use the radio list, range, and delete items from a list components
* Use collection repeat to improve performance of large lists
* Display a modal to show related content
* Use an action sheet to display a list of actions for a user
* Load data from an external API and use the CORS proxy in Ionic
